Feature Requests / Improvements
================================================================================
* Multimonitor support (Xinerama, etc)
* Dragable bar at the bottom to change Tilda's height
* Ability to disable keyboard accelerators (close tab, new tab, etc)
* Configurable keyboard accelerators (close tab, new tab, etc)
* Automatically hide tilda when it loses focus (fairly easy)
* Session support, so tilda will load with the same number of tabs that it had
  upon closing
* Ability to rename a tab manually
* Ability to pop up a dialog when the keybinding process fails (EASY now)


Future Plans
================================================================================
* DBus-ize Tilda
  This will make Tilda more of a long-running daemon than a terminal. What I
  envision is one Tilda process per user, with one config file, managing all of
  the Tilda windows (individual terminals) that the user wants. Also, expose all
  of the terminal's properties over DBus, so a completely seperate config
  program can be written. Also, things like "open a new tab in terminal 3, and
  launch XYZ in it" should be possible, and easy.

  Unfortunately, to support this, I am thinking about moving away from
  libConfuse, and moving to the built-in GLib key-value parser (INI-like). This
  should allow a config file like:

  [global]
  setting1 = value1
  setting2 = value2

  [terminal1]
  setting1 = value3

  Which means (to me) that all terminals should have the settings from the
  global section, but terminal1 will have setting1 overridden to a different
  value. This could be used to give different backgrounds or different fonts
  in each terminal, for example, but keep all other properties the same.

  Of course, the DBus stuff should probably be optional, so that you don't have
  to have it installed, nor running. You should be able to start a Tilda which
  is configured with DBus, but not have DBus running. It would be nice if Tilda
  didn't die when DBus dies out from under us.


Possible Translation Problems
================================================================================
Change "Animation Delay" to "Animation Duration"
"Notebook" should be changed to "Window", probably
"tab_pos" error msg (in a switch stmt) should be changed.
