New Translations
================================================================================
We, the Tilda developers, have stopped using Launchpad to assist with our
translation effort. It was located at
https://translations.launchpad.net/tilda/trunk/+pots/tilda

Please directly submit Pull Requests on GitHub to update translations or
initialize new translation.


How to integrate a new translation into Tilda
================================================================================
1) Copy the LANG.po file into the po/ directory.
2) Add LANG to the po/LINGUAS file.

The next time you completely rebuild and install Tilda, it will automatically
compile and install the language file onto your system. Afterwards, if you run
Tilda with the correct LANG environmental variable, Tilda should use your
translation.


How to do a new translation without Launchpad
================================================================================
# If you want to auto generate a pot file template from sources, use xgettext
# from project root directory
xgettext --files-from=./po/POTFILES.in --output=po/LANG.pot

cd po
msginit -l en_US         # (for USA English. Creates en.po)

# ... do the translation in your editor of choice ...

# add your translation to the LINGUAS file, without the .po
# extension.
#
# That would be "en" for the above examples
#
# If po/Makefile does not exist, please configure this project first:
#
# autoreconf --install --verbose --force
# ./configure

Then run the following commands:

make update-po
make update-gmo
cd ..
make
