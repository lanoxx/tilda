/*
 * Mini style-guide:
 *
 * #define'd fragments should preferably have an outermost group, for the
 * exact same reason as why usually in C/C++ #define's the values are enclosed
 * in parentheses: that is, so that you don't get surprised when you use the
 * macro and append a quantifier.
 *
 * For repeated fragments prefer regex-style (?(DEFINE)(?<NAME>(...))) and use
 * as (?&NAME), so that the regex string and the compiled regex object is
 * smaller.
 *
 * Build small blocks, comment and unittest them heavily.
 *
 * Use free-spacing mode for improved readability. The hardest to read is
 * which additional characters belong to a "(?" prefix. To improve
 * readability, place a space after this, and for symmetry, before the closing
 * parenthesis. Also place a space around "|" characters. No space before
 * quantifiers. Try to be consistent with the existing style (yes I know the
 * existing style is not consistent either, but please do your best).
 *
 * See http://www.rexegg.com/regex-disambiguation.html for all the "(?"
 * syntaxes.
